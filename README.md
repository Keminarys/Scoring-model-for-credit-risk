# Scoring-model-for-credit-risk
This is a project I had to do during my apprenticeship, it's based on a kaggle competition (home-credit-default-risk) 

The purpose is to create a dashboard based on a scoring model.
To build this we have to create a model, deploy it using MLflow and test it with Pytest or Unitest
